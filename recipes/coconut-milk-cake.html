    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A super moist and tasty coconut cake. Even better with a cup of coffee on
      the side.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>4 eggs, separated</li>
      <li>1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake
        pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat sugar, butter, and egg yolks together in a bowl using an electric
        mixer until smooth and creamy; add shredded coconut.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir creamed
        butter mixture, alternating with coconut milk, into flour mixture until
        batter is just mixed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until until soft peaks form.
        Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft
        mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold egg whites into batter. Pour
        batter into the prepared cake pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of
        the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
