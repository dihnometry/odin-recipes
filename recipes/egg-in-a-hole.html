    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A delicious runny yolk egg cooked in the center of a piece of toast and
      eaten with a fork is a great way to enjoy an egg in a slightly different
      way.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons bacon grease</li>
      <li>1 slice bread</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Melt the bacon grease in a non-stick pan over low heat.</li>
      <li>
        Cut a 1 1/2 to 2-inch hole from the center of the bread slice; lay in
        the hot skillet. When the side facing down is lightly toasted, about 2
        minutes, flip and crack the egg into the hole; season with salt and
        pepper. Continue to cook until the egg is cooked and mostly firm. Flip
        again and cook 1 minute more to assure doneness on both sides. Serve
        immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
